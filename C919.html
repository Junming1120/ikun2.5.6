    </div>
    <div style="color: black;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/B-919A%40PEK_%2820221226151722%29.jpg" alt="img of C919" style="float:right;width:400px;height:250px;">The Comac C919 is a narrow-body airliner developed by Chinese aircraft manufacturer Comac. The development program was launched in 2008. Production began in December 2011, with the first prototype rolled out on 2 November 2015 and having its maiden flight on 5 May 2017. On 29 September 2022, the C919 received its CAAC type certificate. The first production airframe was delivered to China Eastern Airlines on 9 December 2022 and was put into commercial passenger service on 28 May 2023.</div>
    <p>The aircraft, primarily constructed with aluminium alloys, is powered by CFM International LEAP turbofan engines and carries 156 to 168 passengers in a normal operating configuration over up to 5,555 km (3000 nmi; 3,500 mi). In 2023, COMAC announced that it will develop both a shortened and a stretched version of the passenger jet â€“ similar to the sub-variants offered for the competing Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo family.</p>
    <h2>Naming</h2>
    <p>In the model number, the C stands for "Comac" and "China". The C also forms an "ABC" parallel situation with Airbus and Boeing.</p>
    <h2>exhibit</h2>
    <p><img src="https://m.stnn.cc/upload/resources/image/2023/12/17/2192974.jpg" alt="C919" style="float:right;width:350px;height:205px;">From December 12 to 17, 2023, the C919 and ARJ21 aircraft conducted static displays at the Hong Kong Airport for the first time; the C919 aircraft performed a flight demonstration over Victoria Harbor on the 16th.</p>
    <p>From February 15th to 20th, 2024, C919 and ARJ21 aircraft left mainland China and Hong Kong for the first time and went to Singapore to participate in the Singapore Air Show. This was the first time that C919 passenger aircraft flew overseas and the first time to physically participate in an international air show.</p>
    <h2>feature</h2>
    <p>COMAC stated that since the known sales volume (the vast majority of which are intended orders for Chinese domestic aviation) is much smaller than that of Boeing and Airbus aircraft models of the same size, the unit price of the company's commercial passenger aircraft is inevitably more expensive, but as the number of orders increases will gradually decrease. It uses the same CFM LEAP series engines as the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo series.</p>
    <p><img src="https://tukuimg.bdstatic.com/scrop/f2d645cc210787c251d1d9489a8b2fc0.gif" alt="C919" style="float:left;width:400px;height:200px;">During the design stage, COMAC expected that the C919 would save 15% on fuel, reduce carbon emissions by 50%, carry 8 to 10 more passengers, and have more spacious seats than the Boeing 737 Next Generation and Airbus A320 produced at that time. However, as the two major aircraft manufacturers launch a new generation of narrow-body aircraft, the advantages of saving fuel and reducing carbon emissions have been equalized. COMAC expects that the competitiveness of this product is mainly aimed at economy and comfort, making it comparable to its competitors' new aircraft. Another source pointed out that COMAC is actively seeking to develop domestic engine alternatives and said the order exceeded 1,000 aircraft. However, the report refused to disclose the specific buyer and unit price. However, China Eastern Airlines disclosed that the catalog price of the C919 is US$99 million per aircraft.</p>
    <p>The independent innovation of the C919 passenger aircraft is mainly about the design and management of the project, and it has still completed the development and certification experience during the epidemic, rather than pursuing its localization rate. Mainland Chinese media pointed out that the aircraft industry is composed of multinational cooperation and cooperation. It is not uncommon. According to analysis, its importance is reflected in five aspects: first, the overall plan comes from China; second, it presides over the aerodynamic shape design and conducts related tests; third, the body from design to manufacturing is completely completed by China; fourth, in China integrates various systems from different suppliers; fifth, China conducts comprehensive management.</p>
