<p>On February 20, the C919 aircraft performed a flight show at the Singapore Airshow.</p><img src="https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/1005/process/14f8263831e940a8923961c7b1255e5d.jpg" alt="img of C919" style="float:right;width:400px;height:250px;">
<p>From February 20 to 25, the 2024 Singapore Airshow was held at Changi Convention and Exhibition Center. China's domestic large aircraft C919 and regional aircraft ARJ21 made their debut at the show, attracting high attention from professional audiences and media from all over the world. As China's first jetliner with independent intellectual property rights developed in accordance with internationally accepted airworthiness standards, the C919's overseas debut demonstrated the strength and huge development potential of China's aviation industry, and also highlighted China's open-mindedness and international cooperation capability.</p>
<h2>"China's level of intellectual production has stepped up to a new level."
</h2>
<p>At around 13:00 local time on the 20th, the Changi Convention and Exhibition Center was shining brightly, and many spectators stood on the viewing platform in the heat. They either held up their cell phones or set up their cameras, eagerly awaiting the C919's first flight performance at an overseas airshow.</p>
<p>"It's coming! Coming!" Before the words fell, the C919, with its tail painted in a striking green color, came out through the clouds. Accompanied by the powerful engine roar, the C919 lifted its wings and flew high. Throughout the flight, the C919 completed a number of actions such as turning, climbing, and won the applause of the audience.

"I specially took time off today to come out to watch the debut of Chinese aircraft, it's really worth the trip!"</p>
<p>The Singapore Airshow is one of the world's three major international airshows, and this airshow has attracted more than 1,000 defense and civil aviation companies from more than 50 countries and regions. This exhibition is the first to set up a Chinese national pavilion, 40 Chinese companies displayed their flagship products. A number of Chinese science and technology innovation enterprises brought the latest products to help the sustainable development of the aviation industry, which aroused widespread attention from all walks of life.
</p>
<p>In addition to the flight show, the C919 manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Limited (COMAC), also adopted a variety of exhibition methods, such as model exhibitions and outdoor static displays, presenting to the audience the stage-by-stage achievements of the development of China's commercial airplanes from multiple perspectives.
</p>
<p>Walking into the exhibition hall, the reporter saw a crowd of people in front of COMAC's booth. The newly painted 1:20 scale models of C919, ARJ21 and C929 basic aircraft, 1:32 scale models of ARJ21 business aircraft, medical aircraft, emergency rescue command aircraft, fire-fighting aircraft, cargo aircraft, as well as C919 shortened/plateau and lengthened series of aircraft models attracted the audience to stop and observe the exchange.</p>
<p>Thai tourist Paka told reporters that last time he attended the Singapore Airshow, he saw the model of the C919, "At that time, I was full of expectations for the real aircraft, and this time I finally saw it!"</p>
<p>Outdoor static display area of the C919 airliner, under the wing, beside the wheelset, in front of the nose are photographed in front of the audience. Singapore EDS Aviation Regional Manager Hick said that he attended the Singapore Airshow to see the C919 aircraft made in China. After the field observation, he was deeply shocked, that "China's intellectual level has stepped up to a new level, this exquisite craft of Chinese aircraft is the best embodiment".</p>
<p>China Eastern Airlines cabin department cabin manager Hu Hong is the plane's explainer. She told reporters that a large number of visitors have come in the past two days, including aircraft manufacturers, aviation service providers and supporting industry companies. "Many people are very interested and ask about the details of the cabin. Many people exclaimed that there is plenty of space inside the Chinese aircraft, the seats are comfortable and the color scheme is unique." Hu Hong said that other spectators also went to the cockpit to take a souvenir and praised China's aircraft manufacturing level.</p>
